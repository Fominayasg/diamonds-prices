This project has been developed during Ironhack's data analysis bootcamp.

## Project objectives

The objective of the project is to develop the best model to predict the price of a diamonds basing the results on this dataset:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0121

This is a class competition for the best model.


## Repository structures

The repository is organized as follows:
In the main folder we find the files in where the cleaning and modelling code is developed.
In the "data" folder, the .csv files of the kaggle database. This are included in the .gitignore file so the repositrory is not too heavy.

In outcomes we store the resulting .csv files of the cleaning and the prediction .csv files resulting from de linnear regresion model and the random forest model.

## To summarize the results obtained:
